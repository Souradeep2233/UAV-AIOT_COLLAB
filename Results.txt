Greetings from the AIOT team of UAV:
After months of hard work in data collection, data processing, ML & filter algorithm
fitting we are glad to share our glory over the success in model performance and accuracy.
Report states:
● For Classification over weather conditions:
1. SVC [Accuracy: 82.28 %, F1 Score = .8195 ]
2. XGBOOST [Accuracy: 90 %, F1 Score = .8667]
3. Naive Bayes[Accuracy: 91.25 %, F1 Score = .9117]
4. Random Forest [Accuracy: 93.67 %, F1 Score = .9369]
5. Softmax [Accuracy: 96.20 %, F1 Score = .9618]
● For Regression of Temperature, Humidity, and Precipitation Probability prediction:
1. For Maximum temperature : [ R2 score = .9572, using Linear Regression]
2. For minimum temperature : [ R2 score = .9810, using 2nd order Polynomial
Regression]
3. For Humidity :[ R2 score = 1.0, using Regression over any degree]
4. For precipitation chance(continuous) :[[R2 score = .9998, using 2nd order
Polynomial Regression]
● The Kalman filter has been successfully deployed and working fine.
With this, we are only left with the final stage of deployment via edge computing (Raspberry
Pi) and cloud computing combined ( Cloud).
The research paper is on the verge of total completion, with just the finishing touches of graph
and model evaluation, and explanation entry.
